## ALIGNMENT WITH PROF. RUSSELLO'S WORK

| Russello Paper | Portfolio Project | Connection |
|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| HT2ML | Day 8 (ht2ml_phishing) | Direct implementation |
| MultiPhishGuard | Day 4 (multi-agent) | Multi-agent detection |
| FL + ZK-proofs | Days 9-11 (verifiable FL) | ZK verification |
| Guard-GBDT | Day 12 (privacy_preserving_gbdt) | Privacy-preserving trees |
| Eyes on the Phish | Day 14 (human_aligned) | Explainability |

**Alignment Quality**: Perfect - Every major paper has corresponding implementation.

## DEMONSTRATED CAPABILITIES

1. **Privacy-Preserving ML**: HE, TEE, DP, secure aggregation
2. **Federated Learning**: Horizontal FL, vertical FL, verifiable FL
3. **Security Research**: ZK proofs, adversarial robustness, Byzantine defense
4. **Production Engineering**: APIs, monitoring, Docker, dashboards
5. **Research Communication**: Papers, proposals, documentation

## STRENGTHS FOR PhD APPLICATION

1. **Breadth**: 6 research areas demonstrated
2. **Depth**: HT2ML implementation is publication-quality
3. **Reproducibility**: All code tested and documented
4. **Impact**: Real-world phishing detection problem
5. **Innovation**: Novel combinations (HT2ML + FL + ZK)

## PUBLICATION POTENTIAL

1. **HT2ML Phishing (Day 8)**: Extend to full paper
2. **FedPhish System (Days 17-18)**: System paper
