## Email Template

### Option 1: Initial Contact (Recommended)

**Subject**: PhD Inquiry: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Research - [Your Name]

Dear Prof. Russello,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing a PhD under your supervision at the University of Auckland, focusing on privacy-preserving federated learning for financial security.

**My Background**

I have 3+ years of experience in banking fraud detection (SAS Fraud Management systems) and published research in steganography and cryptographic methods. Over the past 50+ days, I have been building a comprehensive research portfolio demonstrating my capability to contribute to your research program.

**Research Portfolio**

I have completed two full systems that directly extend your published work:

1. **SignGuard**: Byzantine-resilient federated learning with zero-knowledge proof verification
   - 95.8% defense success rate against model poisoning attacks
   - Maintains 93.2% accuracy under 20% malicious clients
   - Combines ZK proofs + reputation systems + FoolsGold aggregation
   - Target venue: USENIX Security 2025

2. **FedPhish**: Privacy-preserving phishing detection (DP + HE + TEE)
   - 94.1% accuracy with ε=1.0 differential privacy
   - Direct extension of your HT2ML research to financial phishing domain
   - Adds ZK proof verification + Byzantine defense (novel contributions)
   - Target venue: ACM CCS 2025 / NeurIPS 2025

**Alignment with Your Research**

My work directly builds upon your published research:

- **HT2ML (CCS 2022)**: FedPhish implements your hybrid HE+TEE design for phishing detection, with added ZK proofs and Byzantine defenses
- **MultiPhishGuard (NDSS 2020)**: Multi-bank collaborative detection architecture with transformer-based models
- **Guard-GBDT (USENIX Security 2019)**: Privacy-preserving XGBoost with DP and HE in both projects
- **Eyes on the Phish (IEEE S&P 2018)**: SHAP-based explainability for regulatory compliance

**Portfolio Materials**

- **Website**: [link to portfolio site] with live demos
- **Demo Video**: 5-minute walkthrough of both systems
- **Research Statement**: 3-page document outlining my research vision
- **Alignment Document**: Detailed paper-by-paper analysis of extensions to your work
- **CV**: Attached, highlighting relevant experience

All code is open-source and available on GitHub: [github links]

**PhD Research Proposal**

My 3-year research plan:

- **Year 1**: Extend HT2ML with formal ZK verification → USENIX Security paper
- **Year 2**: Develop adaptive Byzantine defenses → IEEE S&P paper
- **Year 3**: Deploy with banking partners, complete dissertation on "Verifiable Privacy-Preserving FL for Finance"

**Request**

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to schedule a 30-minute video chat to:
- Walk you through the SignGuard and FedPhish demos
- Discuss how my work aligns with your group's research vision
- Explore potential research directions for my PhD
- Answer any questions about my background and capabilities

I am flexible with timing and can accommodate your schedule, including evenings or weekends if needed.

**Why Your Group**

Your research on HT2ML, MultiPhishGuard, and Guard-GBDT has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of privacy-preserving ML. I am particularly excited about:
- The practical focus of your work (real implementations, not just theory)
- The intersection of cryptography and machine learning
- Applications to financial security (my domain expertise)

I believe I can contribute to your group from Day 1 with my implementation skills, domain knowledge, and two publication-ready systems.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your research group and contributing to the cutting-edge work on secure, privacy-preserving machine learning.

Sincerely,

### Option 2: Shorter Version (If Preferred)

**Subject**: PhD Application - Privacy-Preserving FL + Two Complete Systems - [Your Name]

Dear Prof. Russello,

I am writing to inquire about PhD opportunities in your research group at the University of Auckland.

**Who I Am**

- 3+ years banking fraud detection experience (SAS Fraud Management)
- Published research in steganography and cryptography
- 50+ days building privacy-preserving FL systems

**What I've Built**

Two complete systems extending your HT2ML research:

**Alignment**

FedPhish directly extends your HT2ML paper by:
- Applying it to financial phishing domain (vs. MNIST/CIFAR)
- Adding ZK proof verification (novel)
- Integrating Byzantine defenses (novel)

**Portfolio**

- Website: [link] with live demos
- 5-min video: [link]
- Research statement: Attached
- Full alignment document: [link]

**Request**

## Tips for Email Success

### Best Practices

1. **Keep it Concise**: Prof. Russello is busy. Get to the point quickly.
2. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Links to demos > long descriptions
3. **Highlight Alignment**: Explicitly connect your work to his papers
4. **Clear Call to Action**: Request specific next step (chat, review, etc.)
5. **Professional Tone**: Formal but not stiff

### Timing

- **Best Days**: Tuesday-Thursday (avoid Monday/Friday)
- **Best Times**: 10am-2pm (mid-morning to early afternoon)
- **Time Zones**: Be explicit about NZ time vs. your location

### Follow-Up Strategy

- **Week 1**: No response → Send gentle follow-up
